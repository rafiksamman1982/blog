## Welcome, I'm Rafik Samman

I'm a software developer from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Covid-19 has given me enough time to reflect and decide what I want to do with my knowledge in this space. 
 
You can reach out to me for Enterprise Application development work, software development career advice and mentorship.

I've been a software developer for the last 10 years, and for the last 6+ years have been the Team Lead of the Deployment Team at one of Constellation Software Inc's subsidiaries.

I'm looking to give back to the community, to support up and coming developers and cultivate my own network of technology professionals organically.
